**Note**
- Since we cannot input negative number, the first input number cannot be negative.
For instance, cannot input -2 at the first time but can input 0 - 2 to get -2
- When multiple operation is clicked, for instance, click "+" then "-", it will use the first input operation.
and will show an alert message. Eg. 3 + - (alert mssg) = 8
- If an negative number is inputted, it will show an alert message.
to request for a proper number to input.
- prevValue: is the full previous value.
- prevVal: is used to append the input number.
- prev: is previous input
- cur: is current input
